# Women’s Labor-Market Outcomes Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes labor-market outcomes among women, focusing on wage inequality,
race, union membership, and job stability.

## Research Questions
- How unequal are hourly wages among women?
- How symmetrical is educational attainment(grade)?
- Does race affect women’s wages?
- Does union membership affect job stability?
- Which factors predict union membership among women?

## Data
The dataset contains information on women’s hourly wages, educational attainment,
race, union membership, marital status, and job tenure.

## Methods
- Univariate analysis (wages and education)
- Two-way ANOVA (race and union membership on wages)
- Logistic regression (determinants of union membership)
- Survival analysis (job tenure by union status)

## Key Findings
- Hourly wages are extremely unequal among women.
- Education is relatively evenly distributed and does not explain wage inequality alone.
- Race significantly affects wages and access to union membership.
- Union membership does not increase wages but significantly improves job stability.

## Tools
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- statsmodels
- lifelines
- matplotlib
